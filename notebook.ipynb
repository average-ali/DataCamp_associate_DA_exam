I have modified the column values to make them shorter and improve readability during analysis. All the zeros were removed.\n\n**Time to Close:** Has negative value(s). I thought the most probable reason for this would be a typo, so I decided to remove the negative sign and keep the row.\n\n**Individuals on Claim:** Values ranging from 0 to 41.Surprisingly, there are 7 rows in which the number of individuals on the claim is equal to 0. Either these rows are invalid or incorrect values have been entered for this specific column; or there is some other way a claim can be registered. All things considered, I decided not to remove these rows; the dataset is already relatively small.\n\n**Location:** Each row had one of four possible values (SAO LUIS, RECIFE, FORTALEZA, and NATAL).\n\n**Linked Cases:** Has binary values(True, False) only, and none of the values in the column are missing. Very few cases were linked to other claims.\n\n**Cause:** There are 3 values only, as expected- 'vegetables', 'meat', and 'unknown'. In the data dictionary, 'vegetable' was written. I could have replaced 'vegetables' with 'vegetable', but in the business context, it would not make any difference. This column was the only one with missing values- had 78 in total.As instructed, missing values were replaced with 'unknown'. \n\n**Claim Amount:** Extracted only the numeric part of the value as specified. Values displayed as an integer.\n\n**Amount Paid:** For all of the claims, the Amount Paid was less than the Claim Amount. Column had no missing values.\n\n**Resulting DataFrame:**\n\n![df_res](df_res.jpeg)\n\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"953f4ca7-6ad4-4d9b-8fcc-a39c21179cf9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## How does the number of claims differ across locations?\nHighest number of claims were registered in SAO LUIS(30), followed by RECIFE(25). In all locations more than 20 claims were made. So, in terms of total number of claims, the difference between Locations is not extraordinary. Nevertheless, the legal department should take a look at outlets in SAO LUIS first.\n\n![v1_count](v1_count.jpeg)\n\n## What is the distribution of time to close claims?\nMost of the claims are generally closed withn 1200 days, while a few of the claims took more than 1500 days. There are some outliers in the data as well. The legal team should focus on claims that took more than 1000 days first. Further analysis could be performed to find out the impact of other factors('Claim Amount', 'Individuals on Claim', 'Linked Cases') on 'Time to Close'. This would reveal more insight about why some claims take longer than others to close down. \n\n![v1_hist](v1_hist.jpeg)\n\n**Using boxplot to plot distribution for each location.**\n\nAs shown by the boxplot below, the data spread for 'Time to Close' is largest for SAO LUIS, with a fair number of the claims taking more than 1500 days to close, and some even taking 2500+ days. In other locations, few cases/ claims cross 1500 days, and no claim took more than 2500 days to close down.\n\n![bx](bx.jpeg)\n \n","metadata":{},"id":"c80260f9-552c-4f13-8ce9-646380271175","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\nDescribe what you found in the analysis and how the visualizations answer the customer questions in the project brief.

Claims in SAO LUIS take the most time to close on average- more than 1000 days, around double the average time to close claims in NATAL. RECIFE comes second on the list, followed by FORTALEZA.\n\n![avg](avg.jpeg)\n\nThe visuals show that there is a noticeable difference in the time it takes to close claims across locations, especially between SAO LUIS and other locations. Among the four locations, FORTALEZA and RECIFE are closest to each other, in terms of the time it takes to close claims. Nonetheless, the difference is still significant. In NATAL, fewest number of claims were registered and the average time to close down claims was the lowest.\n\n\n**Just to wrap it up**, let's take a look at the accumulated sum of Amount Paid to close claims in each location. The y-axis(Amount Paid) shows values in Millions( in Brazil's currency). Eventhough claims in NATAL take the least time to close down on average, the accumulated sum to close down all claims exceeds that for any other location. This is surprising, given the fact that fewest claims were made in NATAL. This insight suggests that we should take a look at other factors also, to determine the overall severity of problems caused by these claims. \n\n![sum](sum.jpeg)\n","metadata":{},"id":"0770e517-c2fa-4872-991d-2ae91aa26b43","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
